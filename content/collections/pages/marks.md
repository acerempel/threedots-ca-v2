        text: 'What is the essence of a punctuation mark? A typographic symbol? A mark denoting a certain pause or lift or cadence in speech? An indicator of syntactic structure? A weapon? A fine herb? Probably all of these and more. Why not, then, also a sign by which to categorize paragraphs of prose?'
