        text: "I have been obsessively reading A View from the Cycle Path by David Hembrow recently –\_a treasure trove of wisdom about the state of the art in safe, comfortable, and convenient cycling infrastructure. Such infrastructure is apparently all over the place in the Netherlands – though not uniformly – but very rare in Canada and virtually nonexistent in Ottawa, the city in which I currently reside. ‘Virtually nonexistent’\_might seem unfair, but I mean specifically infrastructure that is safe "

        text: "By ‘comfortable’\_I mean what allows you to feel at ease, which includes feeling safe; clearly there is some overlap with safety, although safety can also be measured empirically to some extent; these three criteria, though, are meant, as I use them, to be qualitative and interrelated."

        text: "Painted bike lanes, for example, don't count –\_not especially safe and certainly not comfortable. The two-way cycle tracks on O'Connor are fine, but we can aim for better. Their safety may leave something to be desired when it comes to intersections – there is the potential for conflict between cyclists going in either direction and left-turning automobiles. A separate signal phase for cyclists would fix this."

        text: 'As for comfort, it depends on what you''re used to. The width and separation from automobile traffic are okay – but wouldn''t it be even more comfortable, to stretch the meaning of the word a little, if you could ride side by side with your friend, without feeling nervous in the slightest about two other cyclists riding side by side passing you in the opposite direction? I don''t know that Ottawa has any cycling infrastructure that allow for side-by-side riding. I would say that it would be abominable if sidewalks were only wide enough to accommodate people walking single file in each direction, but that is actually just the situation with most sidewalks in Ottawa, and, I think, most Canadian cities.'
