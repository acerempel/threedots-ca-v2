        text: '. The reason alphabetical order is so important is that it made possible larger-scale methods of organizing written words such as indexes: it doesn''t matter for its own sake. This book therefore has more to say about the methods of organizing that alphabetical order has undergirded – and, respectively, that its predecessors in ordering things have undergirded – than about alphabetical order itself.'

But alphabetical order turned out to have a decisive advantage: to use it (whether to create an ordered list or to look something up in one), you only need to know the '
