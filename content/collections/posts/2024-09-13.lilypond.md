        text: 'I am not a terribly creative person -- so I sometimes claim. Really, when I deny I am creative, I am replying to a popular yet rather circumscribed idea of creativity: if, when someone says to me, "You are a rather creative person, are you not?", I should say, "Oh yes!", I would lead them to imagine that I spend my spare time writing novels or painting or what not, when in fact I do nothing of the kind. I am in fact totally useless at inventing stories and I have no facility with the visual arts. Originality in the aesthetic realm eludes my abilities.'
