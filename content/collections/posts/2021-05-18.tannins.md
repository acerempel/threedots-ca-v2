        text: 'I have fallen lately into the habit, when I make some tea for myself or for Jocelyn, of afterward taking the just-steeped tea-bag in my hand and crushing it, squeezing out the remaining concentrated tea and letting it flow, tannin-rich like a bed of red pine needles in the boreal forest in the summer, through my fingers and down to my wrist.'
