Except the water is not literally boiling at that point, is it?—it loses heat in the course of being poured. And there is always a little span of time between the shutting off of the kettle and the pouring of the tea – poised though I may be over the counter, teacups already prepared, I can only react and move the kettle so quickly. Persons wise in these matters say that black tea should be brewed with boiling water: but is that even possible?'

For the truth is, the glorious cloud of tannins does not always bloom forth from the tea bag with equal swiftness – so I have observed; some cups of tea are potent and cheering, others weak and piteous. You may expect the latter to result from water that is not hot enough, and that is certainly true; my contention, however, is that it can equally arise from water that is '

        text: '. When similar research is done upon the brewing temperature of tea, what will be revealed? Will the temperature turn out not to make such a difference as is commonly supposed? Or will it turn out – as I conjecture – that tea plays by different rules than coffee, and that 98-degree water is required for a proper brew?'
