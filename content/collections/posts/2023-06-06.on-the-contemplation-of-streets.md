        text: 'It happens from time to time that, as I am out walking with some friends of an evening, one of my companions says to the others, "Say--where has Alan gone?" In my Atlantic years, the answer would be that I had simply disappeared--slipped down an alleyway or into a manhole or somesuch. I have since given up that particular hobby, however,--amusing as it was;--no, these days, my friends need only turn around to find me standing at the street corner, staring indistinctly. "Just what," they ask each other, "is he staring at?"--At the intersection itself, probably trying to think whether protected bike lanes can be fit within the right-of-way if a certain amount of automobile parking is removed.'
