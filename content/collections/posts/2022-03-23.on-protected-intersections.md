        text: 'Their purpose is to be safer for pedestrians and cyclists. They are indeed safer than regular intersections, because of a few features: Setback of crosswalk and crossride from roadway; Refuge for cyclists at corners so that they can make two-stage left turns; Something else.'

        text: 'But two-stage left turns are dumb. Moreover, there are still conflicts with right-turning and left-turning motor vehicles with pedestrians and cyclists going straight. And for a cyclist to turn left, you have to go straight twice – twice the delay and twice the potential for conflicts with motor vehicles!'

        text: 'Conflicts can be eliminated through design of signal phases. You can have for example protected left turn and protected right turn phases. That''s the best way. But you still have the two stage left turn nonsense problem. Which is actually a problem for pedestrians too, but less so because all sidewalks are two-way.'
