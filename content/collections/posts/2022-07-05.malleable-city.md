        text: 'Historically, Mr. Sim argues, the basic pattern of urban built form is the block: several buildings with their walls right up against each other forming a more-or-less rectangular perimeter around an enclosed outdoor area. Streets are formed by the gaps between blocks. In U.S. and Canadian cities, this pattern is inverted: streets divide the land into blocks, in which detached buildings of various sizes are built. The older pattern has a number of advantages:'

                text: 'The buildings surrounding the courtyard are actually separate buildings: they can have different owners and different uses; they each have their own ground-floor access to the courtyard and to the street. By contrast, in Canada, the rare courtyard is usually enclosed by a single building that takes up an entire block. This means less diversity of ownership and use and less connection to the surrounding streets.'
