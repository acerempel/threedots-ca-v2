        text: ". It's easy to say that Europe's got it figured out when it comes to urban design. I would not have been able to tell you, though, what are the specific features or patterns that make a city pleasant and livable in the way that I imagine many European cities to be. This book does tell you â€“\_and it's not entirely what I expected."

        text: 'The basic question that Soft City explores is: How do we build dense urban form that is pleasant and livable for humans and adapted to their bodies? Urban density is desirable, because cities are by definition places where people want to live close together and where space is therefore scarce; the benefits of living in a city (proximity to purveyors of goods and services, sharing of resources and infrastructure like water and roads) are therefore compromised the more the urban form sprawls out. But thirty-storey residential towers are maybe not desirable, because they are too tall. '

        text: 'Historically, Mr. Sim argues, the basic pattern of urban built form is the block: several buildings with their walls right up against each other forming a more-or-less rectangular perimeter around an enclosed outdoor area. Streets are formed by the gaps between blocks. This pattern is inverted in U.S. and Canadian cities: streets divide the land into blocks, in which detached buildings of various sizes are built. The older pattern has a number of advantages:'

                text: "The space within a block forms a courtyard: a space that is shared by the inhabitants of the buildings forming that block, yet offers a degree of privacy from the general commotion of the city. In Canada, it's quite hard to find such spaces: an apartment-dweller's only outdoor space may well be the nearest public park. In the older model, public parks play a complementary role to these semi-public courtyards."

                text: 'The buildings surrounding the courtyard are actually separate buildings: they have different owners and perhaps different uses or purposes; they each have their own ground-floor access to the courtyard and to the street. In Canada, you sometimes see a single large apartment building or office building with a courtyard, but this does not allow for the same diversity of uses or the same ease of access to the outdoors as does the case of multiple adjacent buildings.'

                text: 'The side walls of these buildings are actually touching one another with no space in between. This reduces wear on the buildings and the cost of heating, and of course allows them to enclose a courtyard. Of course there cannot then be windows on these walls; but windows facing a neighbouring building never get much light anyway. Windows facing the courtyard, on the other hand, can indeed get a lot of light and air. This is a real advantage if you compare with a courtyardless building that takes up an entire city block, which are often seen in Canadian downtowns.'
