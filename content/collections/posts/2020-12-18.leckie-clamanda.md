Certainly she seems to be a lover of songs and choral music: her main character sings to herself continually and is fond of collecting songs from societies that she visits. Leckie also has a music degree from Washington University in St Louis, Missouri.'

In it, Leckie reveals that she is a shape-note singing aficionado, and tells the reader that the song quoted above is indeed from the Sacred Harp, as I had suspected. She even gives a plug for shape note singing:'

I don't think you always see this done so well in science fiction or fantasy."
