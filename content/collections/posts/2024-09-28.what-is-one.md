        text: "The problem is the number one. This is serious business. Everything depends on it. Because--well, it's hard to explain, but basically: I cannot account for its existence. And if not for one, then what of two, and three, and four, and--"

        text: "Except you might be thinking, what's the problem? Why can't we just jump straight to two? And it almost seems like you're right. After all, if I have two mugs, say, then they are two. And I can tell that they are two because this one is green and this one is blue, for example. They are distinct."

        text: "--Okay, but what if they are the same colour?--No problem! I can take a piece of chalk--the sage's timeless tool--and draw a line on my floor and put a mug on one side and a mug on the other, and there are both mugs. We've divided mug from mug, we've divided them in twain, and we've got two. That's what twain means--two. Old English or something, I guess."

        text: "Okay. We have distinction--we have two. Nce. We can keep going--more distinctions, more numbers. Doesn't have to be mugs. Could be pancakes. Could be piles of salt. But it's better not to think about piles of salt -- that one has its own problems. Point is, now that you have two, you can draw two lines of chalk, and then you can distinguish between three mugs. So now you have three. You can go on that way as long as you like--or, practically speaking,, until you run out of chalk. I doubt anyone's broken through the high thousands. Who wants to hold a piece of chalk for that long?"

        text: "I know--you're thinking, \"But isn't each mug one?\" It's not that easy, unfortunately. Like what if you drop your mug on the tile floor of your kitchen and it breaks in two? Is it one mug or two? Or none? What if you don't know how many pieces it's broken into? You might not keep enough chalk around to count them. Suppose your mug, as some do, has an inside and an outside. Count 'em--that's two! I know it's not everyone's style, but I prefer to skip over all these conundra and just say: there is this side of the chalk line and that side, and each is one, and both are two."
