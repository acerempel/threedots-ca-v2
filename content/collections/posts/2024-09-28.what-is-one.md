        text: "Let's take two, for a start, because, oddly enough, it works out to be less troublesome.--Zany, yeah? But bear with me.--If I have two mugs, then they are two. And I can tell that they are two because this one is green and this one is blue, for example. They are distinct.--Okay, but what if they are the same colour?--No problem. I can take a piece of chalk and draw a line on my floor and put a mug on one side and a mug on the other, and there are both mugs. We've divided mug from mug, we've divided them in twain, and we've got two. That's what twain means--two. Old English or something, I guess."

        text: "Okay. We have distinction--we have two. Very nice. We can keep going--more distinctions, more numbers. Doesn't have to be mugs. Could be pancakes. Could be piles of salt. But it's better not to think about those. Those ones just cause more problems. Although I guess the chalk helps here two.--Or does it? Because what if you make one pancake, then you eat it, and then you--okay, never mind. The point is, now that you have two, you can draw two lines of chalk, and then you can distinguish between three mugs. So now you have three. You can go on that way as long as you like--or until you run out of chalk. Practically speaking, I doubt anyone's broken through the high thousands."
