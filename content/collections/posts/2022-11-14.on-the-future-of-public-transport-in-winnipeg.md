        text: ' It describes the purpose of each type of route and it tells you what attributes each has that orient it toward that purpose. Every city has multiple types of route – for example, Ottawa, where I currently live, has "frequent", "local", "rapid", and "connector" routes. But Ottawa''s marketing materials don''t make it clear whether, for instance, the "rapid" routes run just as frequently as the "frequent" routes. Winnipeg''s transit plan, however, clearly states each route type''s purpose, frequency, stop spacing – almost everything you need to know about what kind of service a route provides.

If buses were faster, they would compete better with cars as a transportation option and they would be somewhat cheaper to operate; increasing the space between stops (usually called "stop consolidation") is known to speed buses up and so helps achieve these goals. Winnipeg''s transit plan specifies the stop spacing for each type of route'
