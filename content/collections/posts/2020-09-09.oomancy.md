As I was sweeping the floor in anticipation of their arrival, I reflected upon the first time I tried my hand at oomancy.\_Or perhaps, I muse, oomancy tried its hand at me: I had not intended to use the eggs for divination, but does it not in retrospect seem possible—even likely—that divination took place?"

I shall move with haste and outstrip the passage of the minutes!” Of course the passage of the minutes was indifferent to my haste.'

Upon seeing the eggs, my friend remarked that I had brought no implements with which to crack them: I, to whom, although sympathetic towards this point, it would never had occurred to bring utensils for that purpose, could think of no course of action but to demonstrate my family’s traditional method of egg-cracking, namely, knocking the egg firmly against the forehead:—and smashed the runny, undercooked egg all over my face.'
