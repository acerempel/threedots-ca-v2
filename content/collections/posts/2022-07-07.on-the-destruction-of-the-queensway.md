        text: "It's no secret that I despise the Queensway – the controlled-access highway that runs straight through the middle of Ottawa in a more-or-less east-west direction. Its eight lanes and frequent on-ramps and off-ramps take up so much precious urban space and engender transportation demand that badly congests the rest of the city's road network. But I don't dream only of the Queensway's destruction, for that alone would benefit no one: I also contemplate what could replace it (whose environmental benefits would be worth the carbon emitted in the course of its destruction)."

It would connect with the other O-Train lines at Lees, Dow's Lake, and Lincoln Fields."

                        text: 'The regional railway, on the other hand, would stay entirely in the Queensway right-of-way, with stations at Tremblay (for the Via Rail connection), Bank St, maybe Bayshore, definitely Kanata, and going onward to points west (Carleton Place, etc.), as well as stations in Orleans and Cumberland and points east. This is not ‘commuter rail’ (although of course it would be used for commuting by some): it would have all-day two-way service. Not sure about frequency – once an hour would probably be fine to start with.'

        text: "The bicycle way I think is particularly important. I believe there is a lot of desire for a safe and straightforward bicycle route at about that latitude, but it doesn't exist, and it can't really exist while the Queensway stands. Catherine and Isabella streets are ruled out precisely because they have may Queensway off-ramps and on-ramps on them; the Gladstone-Byron route would have potential were it not for the Parkdale-Holland discontinuity; the main hazard in that gap, besides the inconvenience, is that Parkdale is perpetually congested because of the Queensway entrances and exits on it."
