        text: "Bank Street in Ottawa is a bit of a conundrum for me. It's the only street that runs continuously in a north-south direction from downtown all the way to the edge of the urbanized area with development all along it. (It's that last criterion that rules out Bronson / Airport Parkway, which turns into a controlled-access highway south of the Rideau River.) It plays the role of traditional main-street for much of its length –\_especially from the Rideau River northward, where it is lined throughout with tightly packed shops in buildings that extend right up to the edge of the sidewalk; south of the river, there is still more or less continuous commercial development, but it is more automobile-oriented. It runs right through the densest parts of Centretown and downtown and has its northern terminus at Parliament Hill. For these reasons, I judge it the most important north-south axis in the city – important symbolically, for motorists, for public transit, and –\_perhaps someday –\_for cyclists. Ottawa is a city of predominantly east-west extent, so north-south transportation seems comparatively neglected. Its fastest and highest-capacity transportation corridors – the Queensway and the O-Train Line 1 – both run mainly east-west. "
